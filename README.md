# WinRestoreScript
Restore script for my Windows. The script restores an SDA disk image taken on the SAMSUNG HD322HJ hard drive. Here the drive to be restored is SDA. If I didn't know which drive to restore I could get the disk ID and restore it. As I know my drive is the SDA I already pre-set to 'partimage restore /dev/sdaX' (where X is the partition number).
